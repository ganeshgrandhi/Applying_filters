# Applying_filters
This project is useful to apply namely three different filters namely; EchoFilter, LowPassFilter and HighPassFilter.
The user will login to a web application, which gives him access to use the filter.

#Current Status
The filter feature is fully functional if the set of instructions are followed.
The design of the frontend is aesthetic and functional. However, there are few issues in calling the applet via the web application which are being worked on.
