# Applying_filters
This project is useful to apply namely three different filters; EchoFilter, LowPassFilter and HighPassFilter.
The user will login to a web application, which gives him access to use the filter.

#Current Status
The filter feature is fully functional (with regard to the set of instructions).
The design of the frontend is aesthetic and partially functional. However, there are few issues in calling the applet via the web application which are being worked on.
